# Polish Follow-Ups Queue

The continuous polish loop (`tools/polish-loop.sh`) picks from this list. Add ideas here when you notice something too big for a single iteration.

## Open — visual / UX polish

- Crossfade outfit mesh when the player switches in the creator (currently hard-cuts on GLB swap)
- Migrate Character3DCreatorScreen + ShopScreen pack chips to the shared `<FilterChip>` component (src/components/ui/FilterChip.tsx exists)
- Extract the blur backdrop style from modals (EmotePickerModal3D, OutfitPreviewModal, MilestoneToast, HSLColorPicker) into a reusable `<BlurOverlay>` component
- Audit `Animated.Value` uses — some could move to Reanimated `useSharedValue` for native-thread perf
<!-- ProfileScreen 3D portrait shipped below -->
<!-- MilestoneToast 3D preview + pulsing glow + confetti shipped below -->
- DailyRewardPopup day-7+ could show a scaled-up celebration (confetti, bigger icon) when the reward is outfit/pet/title vs coins
<!-- Shop "Outfit of the Day" HOT badge pulse + warm glow shipped below -->

## Open — retention polish

- Streak-recovery mechanic — one "freeze" per week so a single missed day doesn't reset progress
- Milestone screen in Profile showing progress toward each milestone (bars, percentages)
- Welcome-back bonus if player returns after 3+ days away (coins + free outfit of choice)
- Notification to claim daily spin if they opened the app but forgot (1h after last open)

## Open — code quality

<!-- friends.ts, friendsStore.ts, EmoteWheel.tsx, EmoteBar.tsx deleted (commit cc58c09) -->
- Delete `src/services/matchmaking.ts` + `src/services/emotes.ts` remote paths — still imported by GameScreen but only reached if onlineMatchId is set (never, post MP-kill). Careful diff to strip the MP branches in GameScreen first, then delete.
- `seriesStore.ts` still referenced by GameScreen for single-player series — keep but simplify
- MatchHistoryScreen — does it still render anything meaningful without multiplayer match history? Consider scoping to AI-only or removing
- StageScreen (wager courts) — kept the file but the courts require multiplayer to actually wager. Either gate behind `goldCourt` flag or reframe as "practice courts"
- Migrate Zustand stores to the new subscribeWithSelector pattern for the milestone detection hook (current implementation polls on render)

## Open — beta prep

- App Store / Google Play screenshots — use web preview at 1920×1080 bucket
<!-- LegalScreen privacy + terms content shipped (commit f14b12d). Still needs a lawyer review pass + the {{SUPPORT_EMAIL}} / {{COMPANY_ADDRESS}} constants updated with final values before submission. -->
- App icon final export (1024×1024, no alpha for iOS)
- Splash screen polish (already has SplashAnimation component)
- Error boundary coverage — ensure ErrorBoundary wraps every screen, not just root
- First-launch tutorial: currently WelcomeOverlay is a bullet list. Consider an interactive 3-screen walkthrough
- Beta tester onboarding — a `/beta` skill or a README section for friends getting TestFlight invites
